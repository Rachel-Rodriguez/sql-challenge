# INSTRUCTIONS 

This project utilizes Data Engineering and Data Analysis to build a SQL database of employees of a corporation called Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. There are six CSV files holding the data of employees. The SQL tables were designed and the data in the CSVs were successfully imported into a SQL database.

# Data Engineering 

Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. The QuickDBD was used in this project. Use the information from ERD to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files and specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

For the primary keys check to see if the column is unique, otherwise create a composite key, which takes two primary keys in order to uniquely identify a row
